# AirQo Ugandan Air Quality Forecast ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¬


## Description

Until recently there has been a lack of data on air quality across sub-Saharan Africa. AirQo has built a low-cost network of sensors and collected data across 65 locations in Uganda. 

The challenge aims to to accurately forecast air quality (as measured by PM2.5 Âµ/m3)  for each hour of the coming 25 hours across five locations in Kampala Uganda. Forecasts will be based on the past 5 days of hourly air quality measurements at each site. We hope forecasts will be used to inform public awareness and be built into safety alerts. 

The ability to accurately predict what air quality will be in the coming days is also essential for empowering everyone from governments to families to make informed decisions to protect health and guide action, just as we do with weather.


## Data 

The data and challanges were kindly provided by Zindi :

[AirQo Ugandan Air Quality Forecast Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/airqo-ugandan-air-quality-forecast-challenge)

One of the main indicators of air quality is PM2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter or around 1/30th the thickness of a human hair) These particles can be generated by traffic exhaust, industry, fossil fuels and many other sources.

The weather indicators available in the train and test are:

- temp: mean temperature recorded at the site over the hour (degrees Celsius)
- precip: total rainfall in mm recorded at the site over the hour (mm)
- wind_dir: mean direction of the wind over the hour (degrees)
- wind_spd: mean wind speed at the site over the hour (metres per second)
- atmos_press: mean atmospheric pressure(atm)

data used: 
- Train.csv
- Test.csv

## EDA

This data has been collected from five sensors stationed across Uganda. Readings are taken every hour. As is the reality with all data there are missing values. This is a challenge for you to overcome.

1. Read data

# ds-modeling-pipeline
Skeleton project for building a simple model in python script
This is the simplest way to do it. We train a simple model in the jupyter notebook, where we select only some features and do minimal cleaning. The output is then stored in simple python scripts.

Data used is the  [coffee quality dataset](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database).

Requirements:
- pyenv with Python: 3.9.4

### Environment

Same procedure as last time...

Use the requirements file in this repo to create a new environment.

```BASH
make setup 

#or 

pyenv local 3.9.4
python -m venv .venv
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If You encounter errors related to statsmodels, try:

```BASH
OPENBLAS="$(brew --prefix openblas)" pip install numpy statsmodels
```

## Usage

In order to train the model and store test data in the data folder and the model in models run:

```bash
#activate env
source .venv/bin/activate

python train.py  
```

In order to test that predict works on a test set you created run:

```bash
python predict.py models/linear_regression_model.sav data/X_test.csv data/y_test.csv
```

## Limitations

development libraries are part of the production environment, normally these would be separate as the production code should be as slim as possible
